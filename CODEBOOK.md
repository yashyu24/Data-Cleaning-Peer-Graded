##Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer Graded Assignment
### Script Name: 'Run_file.R'

##Dataset Information
###Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency 
domain.

##Attribute Information
###Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


##Identifiers
- Subject Number - The ID number of the test subject (1-30)
- Activities - The types of activities performed when the measurements were taken (1-6)

## Activity Labels
- 1 Walking: walking during the measurement
- 2 Walking_Up: walking up stairs during the measurement
- 3 Walking_Down: walking down stairs during the measurement
- 4 Sitting: sitting during the measurement
- 5 Standing: standing still during the measurement
- 6 Laying: laying down during the measurement


##What the code in 'run_analysis.R' will do (in order) when the script is run:
- Download UCI HAR Dataset and store file locally
- Load dplyr and tidyr
- Unzip locally stored zip file
- Load activity labels
- Load and select features that include mean or standard deviation
   Create list of feature names
   Transpose this list of feature names
   Make appropriate labels for the data set with descriptive variable names
   Coerce the proper dimensionality of the feature list
- Load training data
   Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
- Load testing data  
   Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one tidy data set: mydata
   Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject: mydata2
- Take averages for each activity
- Take averages for each subject
- Merge the two sets of averages
   Make Feature a labelled column rather than row names in accordance with tidy data theory
- View the first tidy data set: mydata
- View the second tidy data set: mydata2


##Final Data Sets
- mydata: a dataset where all Features and Identifiers are variables and each row is a unique measurement for each subject and activity
- mydata2: a dataset where each unique Identifier is a variable and each row is the set of averages of each variable for each activity 
and each subject
